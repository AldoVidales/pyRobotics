pyRobotics
==========

A Python API to create modules that connect to our BlackBoard (our "home-made" message-passing and shared variables hub... somewhat equivalent to ROS)
(We also have a C# and C++ APIs, although the latter is also under development and has not been tested thoroughly)

These softwares are all part of the work developed at the Bio-Robotics Laboratory at UNAM, and are used in our service robots.

There's currently no documentation (neither for the BlackBoard nor for pyRobotics) and it is still in beta testing, but if someone should be interested in knowing more about any of these projects, you can contact me at adrianrc[dot]89[at]gmail[dot]com.
